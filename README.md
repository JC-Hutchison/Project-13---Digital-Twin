# Project-13---Digital-Twin
This Repository will be for the NCSU ECE 484/485 Senior Design Project 13 - Digital Twin for Energy Efficiency in Smart Manufacturing.

The goal of this project is to develop ML models for the drying section of the Paper Machine at the Pulp and Paper Lab at NC State.
The students working on the project are JC Hutchison, Luke Johnson, Emma Thorssell, Abiha Khanam, and Ethan Rhodes.

The first model will predict how dry the paper will be.
The Second model will predict how much energy is used.
There will be a UI Portion of the project that will display the Paper Dryness and the Energy Used.
There will be a UI Portion of the project that allows Admins to add data to retrain the models.

Ultimately, the model will be in IBM cloud, but we should be able to have everything we need in GitHub.
